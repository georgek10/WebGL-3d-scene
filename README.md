# webgl-3d-scene
A basic WebGL illustration of a 3d scene providing users camera control capabilities.

# Requirements to run
- Browsers by default do not allow retrieval of images from the local system, resulting in the scene not loading properly.
  One solution is to place the images on a secure web-server, by modifying their URLs in the code appropriately.
  **Alternatively**, one can disable the relevant check for secure locations in the preferences of the browser,
  **with all due caution** for any potential problems that may arise from doing so.
- The source code needs to be in the same path location as the asset and library files.
